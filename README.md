Genome assembly and reference comparison of Salmonella enterica using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing

# Introduction
Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have been able to transform biological research, enabling detailed investigation of microbial diversity, evolution and genomic structure (Zhou and Faust, 2025). Long-read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have expanded the scope of genomic analyses across biological and medical research. Genome assembly, which is the process of reconstructing a complete genome sequence from fragmented sequencing reads, has become a central task in microbial genomcis, particularly for bacterial species where high-quality assemblies support downstream analyses.
