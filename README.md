Genome assembly and reference comparison of Salmonella enterica using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing

# Introduction
Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have been able to transform biological research, enabling detailed investigation of microbial diversity, evolution and genomic structure (Zhou and Faust, 2025). Long-read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have expanded the scope of genomic analyses across biological and medical research. Genome assembly, which is the process of reconstructing a complete genome sequence from fragmented sequencing reads, has become a central task in microbial genomcis, particularly for bacterial species where high-quality assemblies support downstream analyses. 

Assembling a genome from raw sequencing reads is computationally and biologically challenging. Sequencing reads contain errors that must be distinguished from true biological variation, and assembly algorithms must accurately identify overlaps between reads to reconstruct the original genome sequence (Altermann et al., 2022). Repetitive genomic regions further complicate assembly, as reads originating from different loci may be indistinguishable, potentially leading to misassemblies or fragmented contigs (Altermann et al., 2022). In addition, uneven sequencing coverage can result in gaps or reduced contiguity, requiring tradeoffs between assembly completeness and accuracy (Altermann et al., 2022). These challenges are strongly influenced by the sequencing technology used and the error profiles associated with different platforms.

Long-read sequencing technologies, such as ONT, offer distinct advantages for genome assembly by producing reads that can span repetitive regions and structural variants, thereby improving assembly contiguity (Bogaerts et al., 2025). Recent improvements in ONT chemistry, particularly the R10 (“Q20”) chemistry, have substantially reduced base-calling error rates and enabled near-complete bacterial genome assemblies without the need for additional short-read data in some cases (Bogaerts et al., 2025). ONT sequencing operates by measuring changes in electrical current as nucleic acid molecules pass through nanopores, with machine-learning-based basecalling translating raw signals into nucleotide sequences (Bogaerts et al., 2025). These long reads are particularly valuable for resolving complex genomic regions and reconstructing overall genome organization (Bogaerts et al., 2025). However, despite these improvements, ONT sequencing remains more error-prone than short-read platforms, with residual errors frequently occurring in homopolymer regions as insertion-deletion (indel) errors (Wick and Holt, 2022).

The limitations of long-read sequencing have motivated the development of hybrid assembly and polishing strategies that combine long reads with highly accurate short-read data (Wick and Holt, 2022). Short-read sequencing can be used to correct errors in long-read assemblies, particularly substitution errors, resulting in improved consensus accuracy (Wick and Holt, 2022). However, short-read polishing approaches rely on accurate read alignment, which is often unreliable in repetitive regions, leaving some long-read errors unresolved (Wick and Holt, 2022). As a result, long-read bacterial genome assemblies frequently retain residual errors even after polishing, highlighting the need to balance contiguity, accuracy, and computational complexity when selecting an assembly strategy.

Following assembly, aligning sequencing reads or assembled contigs to a reference genome provides a framework for evaluating assembly quality and identifying genomic variation. Reference-based alignment involves mapping sequences to a previously assembled genome from the same or a closely related species, enabling efficient detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions. Since genomes within a species typically differ only modestly, reference genomes facilitate comparative analyses and variant calling across samples (Vo et al., 2013). However, reference-based approaches can also introduce bias, as reads or contigs that differ substantially from the reference may align poorly or be excluded entirely. This reliance on a single reference genome may obscure structural variation or novel genomic content, making reference alignment both a powerful and potentially misleading analytical step.

Overall, genome assembly and reference-based comparison require careful consideration of sequencing technologies, assembly methods, and error-correction strategies. Long-read ONT sequencing offers substantial advantages for resolving complex genomic structures, while short-read data and reference genomes provide valuable tools for improving accuracy and interpretability. Understanding the tradeoffs among these approaches is essential for designing robust workflows and accurately interpreting genomic variation in bacterial species such as Salmonella enterica.
